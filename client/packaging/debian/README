build_debian.sh

Runs the Go build for github.com/keybase/client/go/keybase and then
packages that executable into a .deb in this directory. In addition to
setting up the Keybase Go build, you'll need Debian's dpkg-deb tool.
That's installed by default on Debian and Ubuntu, and you can install it
on Arch with "dpkg" in the AUR.

TODO: Add scripts for installing package repos, and figure out the
server side of that.
