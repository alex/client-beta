## Keybase

This repository contains source and releases for:

- Go client and services.
- Protocol definitions and stubs for our services.

**Warning**: This is meant to be a temporary repository, and will be removed when we open the main keybase repo, hopefully very soon.
Thanks for your patience!

This is an exact copy of our source from our main private repo, and all release builds are generated from this repo.
Any pre-built binaries hosted here are also built from the source hosted here.
